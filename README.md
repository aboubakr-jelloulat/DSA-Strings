# String Manipulation in C and C++

This repository is a collection of resources and examples to help you understand and work with **strings** in C and C++. It covers common problems, frequently used string functions, and best practices for string manipulation.

## What is a String?

A **string** is a sequence of characters. In:
- **C**: Strings are arrays of characters terminated by a null character (`\0`).
- **C++**: Strings are objects of the `std::string` class, which provides built-in methods for manipulation.
